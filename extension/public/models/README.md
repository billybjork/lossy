# Silero VAD Model

Place the `silero_vad_v5.onnx` model file in this directory before building the extension.

You can download the model from the official Silero repository:
https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad/releases

After downloading, rename the file to `silero_vad_v5.onnx` and ensure it sits beside this README.
