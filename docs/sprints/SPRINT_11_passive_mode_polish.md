**Status:** ðŸ“‹ Planned
**Priority:** High
**Owner:** TBD
**Progress:** 0%

**Related Sprints**
- âœ… Sprint 10 â€“ Always-On Foundations (passive audio VAD baseline)
- ðŸ”œ Sprint 12 â€“ Continuous Session Persistence
- ðŸ”œ Sprint 13+ â€“ Automated Frame Capture & Diffusion

---

## Purpose

Improve passive mode quality, accuracy, and user experience through ML-based VAD (Silero ONNX), visual status indicators, waveform visualizer, and automatic restart capabilities. These enhancements will reduce false positives from ~10-20% to <5%, provide better visibility into system state, and improve reliability.

**Scope:** Passive mode quality improvements only. Does NOT include frame capture or continuous sessions (deferred to Sprint 12+).

## Detailed Requirements

### 1. Silero VAD Integration

**Current State:**
- Energy-based RMS detection (threshold 0.02)
- ~10-20% false positive rate in noisy environments
- Fast (<5ms per frame) but not very accurate

**Proposed Solution:**
- Silero VAD ONNX model (~2MB, silero_vad.onnx v5)
- Use `onnxruntime-web` directly (note: `@ricky0123/vad-web` is deprecated)
- WebAssembly-only (no WebGPU - unnecessary for VAD's <1ms inference time)
- Inference in offscreen document (AudioWorklet can't run ONNX)

**Architecture:**
```
AudioWorklet
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€ Capture audio frames (30ms chunks)
    â”œâ”€ Send to offscreen document
    â”‚
    â–¼
Offscreen document (Silero ONNX via WebAssembly)
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€ Run inference (~1ms per 30ms frame)
    â”œâ”€ Confidence > 0.5? â”€â”€â–º speech_start
    â”‚
    â–¼
Service worker (passive event handler)
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Load Silero ONNX model (v5) in offscreen document using onnxruntime-web
2. Configure ONNX Runtime to use WebAssembly backend
3. Add Silero inference function (takes Float32Array PCM at 16kHz, returns confidence 0-1)
4. Modify AudioWorklet to send audio frames to offscreen via postMessage
5. Handle model loading failures with user-facing error message (no silent fallback)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Silero loads successfully on Chrome 57+ (100% of potential extension users)
- False positive rate <5% in controlled testing
- Inference latency <5ms per 30ms audio frame
- Clear error message if model fails to load (with troubleshooting instructions)

---

### 2. Visual Status Indicators

**Current State:**
- Text status in sidepanel: "ðŸŽ¤ Passive mode enabled"
- No indication of VAD state (observing vs recording)
- No browser-level indicator

**Proposed Solution:**

**A. Sidepanel Status Badge:**
```html
<div class="vad-status-badge" data-state="observing">
  <div class="indicator"></div>
  <span class="label">Observing</span>
</div>
```

States:
- `disabled` (gray) - Passive mode off
- `observing` (green) - Listening for speech
- `recording` (red, pulsing) - Currently recording
- `cooldown` (yellow) - Cooldown period after recording
- `error` (red) - VAD failed

**B. Browser Action Badge:**
- Show recording count on extension icon
- Example: "3" (3 notes created this session)
- Red background when recording

**C. Optional Video Overlay:**
- Subtle indicator in video player during recording
- User can disable in settings

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add CSS for status badge (colors, animations)
2. Update sidepanel.js to listen for passive_status_update events
3. Implement chrome.action.setBadgeText() for extension icon
4. Add optional canvas overlay in content script

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Status badge updates in real-time (< 100ms latency)
- Browser badge shows current note count
- Overlay is non-intrusive and can be disabled

---

### 3. Auto-Pause Video During Speech

**Current State:**
- Video continues playing while user speaks
- Video audio contaminates user's speech in transcription
- User must manually pause video before speaking
- Video timestamp continues advancing during feedback

**Proposed Solution:**

**Automatic pause/resume on VAD events:**
- When VAD detects `speech_start`: pause video immediately
- When VAD detects `speech_end`: wait brief delay (500ms), then resume playback
- Store pre-pause playback state (was it already paused?)
- Only resume if video was playing before speech started
- User setting to disable auto-pause (default: enabled)

**Architecture:**
```
Service worker (VAD event handler)
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€ On speech_start:
    â”‚   1. Query video playback state via content script
    â”‚   2. If playing â†’ send pause command
    â”‚   3. Store state: {wasPlaying: true, timestamp: 1:23}
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€ On speech_end:
    â”‚   1. Wait 500ms (debounce in case user starts speaking again)
    â”‚   2. Check stored state
    â”‚   3. If wasPlaying â†’ send play command
    â”‚
    â–¼
Content script (video control)
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€ Receive pause/play commands
    â”œâ”€ Find video element via platform adapter
    â”œâ”€ Execute videoElement.pause() or .play()
    â””â”€ Send confirmation back to service worker
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add `pauseVideo()` and `resumeVideo()` methods to platform adapters
2. Modify service worker VAD handlers to send pause/resume messages
3. Add playback state tracking (was video playing before pause?)
4. Implement 500ms debounce before auto-resume
5. Add user setting: "Auto-pause video during speech" (default ON)
6. Show one-time onboarding tooltip: "ðŸ’¡ Video will auto-pause when you speak to prevent audio mixing"
7. Handle edge cases: user manually pauses during recording, video ends during speech

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Video pauses within 100ms of speech detection
- Video resumes only if it was playing before speech (respects user's pause state)
- 500ms delay prevents resume if user speaks again quickly
- No pause/resume if user has disabled setting
- First-time users see one-time explanation of auto-pause behavior
- Works across all supported platforms (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)

### 4. Waveform Visualizer

**Current State:**
- No visual feedback of audio input
- Difficult to debug VAD sensitivity issues

**Proposed Solution:**

**Canvas-based waveform display:**
- Real-time audio amplitude visualization
- Energy threshold line overlay
- Detected speech segments highlighted (green)
- 5-10 second history window

**Architecture:**
```
AudioWorklet
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€ Sample audio every 100ms
    â”œâ”€ Send to offscreen via postMessage
    â”‚
    â–¼
Offscreen document
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€ Forward to sidepanel via chrome.runtime.sendMessage
    â”‚
    â–¼
Sidepanel (Canvas rendering)
    â”‚
    â”œâ”€ Draw waveform (requestAnimationFrame)
    â”œâ”€ Overlay threshold line
    â””â”€ Highlight speech segments
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add canvas element to sidepanel
2. Sample audio in AudioWorklet (downsampled to ~10Hz)
3. Broadcast samples to sidepanel
4. Render waveform with Canvas API
5. Add controls: zoom, pause, clear

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Waveform updates at 10fps minimum
- Clearly shows when audio crosses threshold
- Helps users tune VAD sensitivity
- Performance: <5% CPU usage for rendering

---

### 5. Automatic VAD Restart & Circuit Breaker

**Current State:**
- Heartbeat detects VAD failures (logged to console)
- No automatic restart
- User must manually restart passive mode

**Proposed Solution:**

**Circuit breaker pattern:**

```javascript
const circuitBreaker = {
  maxRestarts: 3,
  resetWindow: 60000, // 1 minute
  restartCount: 0,
  lastRestart: 0,
  state: 'closed' // closed, open, half-open
};

async function handleHeartbeatFailure() {
  if (circuitBreaker.state === 'open') {
    console.log('[Passive] Circuit breaker open, not restarting VAD');
    notifyUser('VAD failed permanently. Please check microphone and reload extension.');
    return;
  }

  const now = Date.now();
  if (now - circuitBreaker.lastRestart > circuitBreaker.resetWindow) {
    // Reset counter after 1 minute
    circuitBreaker.restartCount = 0;
  }

  if (circuitBreaker.restartCount >= circuitBreaker.maxRestarts) {
    // Open circuit
    circuitBreaker.state = 'open';
    console.error('[Passive] Max restart attempts reached, opening circuit');
    notifyUser('VAD failed after 3 restart attempts. Please reload extension.');
    return;
  }

  // Attempt restart
  circuitBreaker.restartCount++;
  circuitBreaker.lastRestart = now;

  console.log(`[Passive] Restarting VAD (attempt ${circuitBreaker.restartCount}/${circuitBreaker.maxRestarts})`);

  try {
    await stopVAD();
    await sleep(1000 * circuitBreaker.restartCount); // Exponential backoff
    await startVAD();

    // Success - transition to half-open
    circuitBreaker.state = 'half-open';
    console.log('[Passive] VAD restarted successfully');
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('[Passive] VAD restart failed:', err);
    // Try again on next heartbeat failure
  }
}
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Add circuit breaker state machine to service worker
2. Modify heartbeat handler to attempt restart on failure
3. Implement exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 3s delays)
4. Add user notifications for permanent failures
5. Telemetry: log restart attempts and success/failure

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- VAD auto-restarts on transient failures (mic permission temporarily denied)
- Circuit opens after 3 failed restart attempts
- User notified when VAD fails permanently
- Telemetry tracks restart success rate

---

### 6. Debug Drawer Improvements

**Current State:**
- Debug drawer exists in sidepanel but indicators are non-functional
- No real-time VAD metrics display
- Limited visibility into system state

**Proposed Solution:**

**Fix and enhance debug drawer:**
- Display current VAD state (observing, recording, cooldown, error)
- Show real-time detection metrics (latency, confidence scores)
- Session statistics (notes created, detection count, uptime)
- Error logging with timestamps
- Manual controls for fallback when needed

**Debug Metrics to Display:**
```javascript
{
  vadStatus: "observing" | "recording" | "cooldown" | "error",
  detectionLatency: "3ms",           // Last inference time
  lastConfidence: 0.85,              // Last Silero confidence score
  sessionsCreated: 12,               // Notes created this session
  detectionCount: 15,                // Total speech detections
  uptime: "45min",                   // How long passive mode running
  errors: [                          // Recent errors with timestamps
    { time: "14:32:15", msg: "Model load failed" }
  ]
}
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Fix broken indicators in current debug drawer
2. Add real-time VAD metrics display
3. Wire up Silero confidence scores to debug UI
4. Add session statistics tracking
5. Implement error log display with copy button

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All debug drawer indicators functional and updating in real-time
- Metrics help troubleshoot VAD issues
- Error logs provide actionable information
- Debug drawer can be hidden/shown without affecting performance

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Silero model fails to load** | VAD unusable, passive mode broken | Clear error message with troubleshooting steps, retry logic |
| **Silero inference slower than expected** | Increased latency, missed speech | Profile in real-world conditions, optimize sample rate conversion |
| **Auto-pause annoys users** | Users disable feature, poor UX | Make configurable (default ON), 500ms debounce, respect manual pause state |
| **Platform adapter pause/play fails** | Auto-pause doesn't work on some sites | Graceful degradation, test across all platforms, log failures |
| **Waveform rendering perf** | High CPU usage, battery drain | Throttle frame rate, use requestAnimationFrame, render in debug drawer only |
| **Circuit breaker too aggressive** | VAD disabled when it could work | Conservative limits (3 restarts, 1min window), user can override |
| **WebAssembly compatibility** | Model won't run | Extremely low risk (99% browser support), but detect and show error if needed |

## Decisions Made

Based on research (see conversation history for details):

1. **Silero model hosting:** CDN recommended (Silero team uses CDN, 2MB is manageable)
2. **WebGPU support:** NO - unnecessary. Silero is optimized for CPU, <1ms inference per 30ms frame on single thread
3. **WebAssembly fallback:** NO - 99% browser support, Chrome 57+ (March 2017) has full support
4. **Waveform location:** Debug drawer - reduces clutter, available when needed for troubleshooting
5. **VAD Tuning UI:** Deferred - not currently needed, Silero defaults should work well
6. **Telemetry dashboard:** Deferred - focus on basic debug drawer metrics only

## Open Questions

1. **Silero confidence threshold:** Use default 0.5 or tune for our use case?
2. **Model caching:** IndexedDB vs browser cache for the 2MB model?
3. **Sample rate conversion:** Do in AudioWorklet or offscreen document?
4. **False positive threshold:** What % is acceptable to users? (targeting <5%)
