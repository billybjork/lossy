# Sprint 03: Video Integration

**Status:** ‚è≥ Planned

---

## Deliverables

- [ ] Content script detects video player on page
- [ ] Extract video metadata (URL, platform, timestamp)
- [ ] Send video context when recording starts
- [ ] Backend creates/finds video record
- [ ] Notes linked to video + timestamp
- [ ] On-page anchor chip shows recording timestamp
- [ ] Ghost comment cards appear near player

---

## Technical Tasks

Platform-specific selectors for:
- YouTube video element

- Air video player

### Task 2: Video Context Module (Backend)

- `lib/lossy/videos.ex`
- `find_or_create_video/1` - Idempotent video creation

### Task 3: On-Page Overlays

- Anchor chip component (shows timestamp)
- Ghost comment cards (preview notes)
- Shadow DOM for style isolation
